The Kid's Puzzler:

By Veda Adnani, Digital Futures, OCAD U.

We see innumerable web and mobile applications and digital media daily, designed for everyone’s favourite target audience - Children. Companies are using unethical means of “persuasive design” to lure kids into spending hours on their gadgets, and often hampering their development in the process. There is a lot of debate globally around the exposure that children should have to technology at a young age. However, no one is addressing this seriously just yet. 

My childhood memories revolve around curiosity. The desire to be on the move constantly, touching things, feeling things, building things and even breaking them! It pains to me see that children today are just handed an iPad to “learn”, and the repercussions of these parental tendencies are probably going to be more drastic than we think. Children are deprived of enjoying the small but glorious interactions with blocks, puzzles and other traditional, tangible toys that were designed with an ethical development framework in mind. 

Puzzles have been around for generations, because they are extremely helpful in a child’s developmental process. In fact they’re even good for adults. They help build cognitive, problem solving, fine motor development, hand-eye coordination, and collaborative skills.

I wanted to create an interactive experience, that combines the best of both worlds. By giving children the toys to develop tactile skills, and simultaneously allowing parents to feel the benefit of technology aided, enhanced educational experiences. 

The Kid’s Puzzler, is a simple shape & colour puzzle for toddlers and young kids, that focuses on using wooden blocks for development. Placing blocks in the right socket on a wooden puzzle board, triggers a delightful digital reaction, that this learning oriented, thus enhancing the learning experience for the child by making it more engaging and rewarding with feedback.



Circuit: Uses the built-in pullup resistors within the Arduino Micro. Aided by copper sheets for circuit completion.
